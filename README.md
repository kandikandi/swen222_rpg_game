#### Model: ####

This package contains most of the game element objects. Most objects are subtypes of the Actor class, which includes its Position on the Board and can return a BoundingBox for collision logic purposes. The Actor subtypes are the moving actors (Player and Enemy), the Container class (which has subtypes CoinBag and Inventory), the Collectable class (which has subtypes Key and coin), as well as Door and Wall.

The GameState class contains a list of the active Actor objects in the game, and is called from other parts of the program to determine current state.

The Collision class is used to run the game collision logic. It is called from the moving Actor objects when they move and gets details of collisions from the GameState object.
